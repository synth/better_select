BetterSelect
============

This simple plugin provides some helpers for, guess what?, a better select control.  It can be used for any normal select drop down
but has a specialized ability to produce a Time select field.  The time select will be a single drop down
with values ranging from 12:00 AM to 12:00 PM to 11:45 PM in steps of 15.(TODO: make the interval configurable)

Why is it better you ask?
=========================
It uses prototype/scriptaculous to replace the standard html select with a text input field, so 
you have full control over the styling and functionality of the select.  Eventually, this
will support autocomplete(TODO)


Example
=======

1. include the js/stylesheets via helper
  better_select_includes
   
    or individually
  
  better_select_javascript_include_tag
  better_select_stylesheet_link_tag

2. Use it
  A. generic select
    better_select_tag 'post[author]', options_for_select([["Me", 0],["You", 1])
  B. Time select
    better_time_select_tag 'post[published_at]', @post.published_at
